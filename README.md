## Images && Video Implementation
**Comic Generation:**
**Image 1:** On a scorching summer day, a thirsty crow soared across the fields in search of water. The sun blazed overhead, and the crow's thirst grew with each passing moment. Despite his exhaustive search, the crow found no water to quench his thirst. Feeling weak and desperate, he spotted a pitcher with a small amount of water. The crow flew down to inspect it, only to find the pitcher's neck too narrow for him to reach the water. He tried tilting the pitcher, hoping the water would flow out, but it was too heavy. Despite the setback, the crow refused to give up. He looked around and noticed pebbles nearby. With a spark of inspiration, he began to pick up pebbles one by one, dropping them into the pitcher. As the pebbles filled the pitcher, the water level rose. Eventually, the water reached a level the crow could drink from.
